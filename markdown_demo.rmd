My first markdown file
=======================

This is my first markdown file, 

first, we're going to load some data.

```{r}
library(datasets)
data(airquality)
summary(airquality)
```

let's first make a pairs plot of the data

```{r}
pairs(airquality)
```

here's a regression model of ozone on wind, solar radiation and temperature

```{r}
library(stats)
fit <- lm(Ozone ~ Wind + Solar.R + Temp, data = airquality)
summary(fit)
```

here's an unordered list:

* first element
* second element
